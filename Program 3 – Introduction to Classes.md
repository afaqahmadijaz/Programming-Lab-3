**ITSE 2321 – OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING JAVA**

**Program 3 – Introduction to Classes**

Create a class named **Employee** that includes three private instance variables, first name (String), last name (String), and monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a _set_ and a _get_ method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value. Write a test class named **Program3** that demonstrates the class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s **yearly salary**. Then give each Employee a 20% raise and display each Employee’s **yearly salary** again. Use the data below to create the two Employee objects, similar to lines 7 and 8 of **Figure 3.9** of your textbook, in your **Program3** class.**First Name Last Name Monthly Salary**

Compile your program and correct all syntax errors and warnings. **You will not receive credit for the program if it does not compile successfully.**

Don’t forget to include lines 1 through 35 **(line 21 must reflect your controlling/main class)** and the **developerInfo method and comments of ProgramTemplate.java**. **You will not get full credit if some of the lines are missing. All classes in this program must be public, non-static and not nested in other classes.**

Run your program and copy and paste the output to a file named **Program3-output.txt**.

Create a folder named, **\_Program3**. Copy your source codes (**Employee.java and Program3.java**) and the output file to the folder. Zip the folder, as a **“.zip”** file, and upload it to Blackboard.

**Before you upload your program to Blackboard:**

• Ensure that your code conforms to the style expectations set out in class and briefly discussed below.

• Make sure your variable names and methods are descriptive and follow standard capitalization conventions.

• Put comments wherever necessary. Comments at the top of each module should include your name, file name, and a description of the module. Comments at the beginning of methods describe what the method does, what the parameters are, and what the return value is. See the **ProgramTemplate.java** for more details.

• _Program readability and elegance are as important as correctness._ After you have written your method, read and re-read it to eliminate any redundant lines of code, and to make sure variables and methods names are intuitive and relevant.

Read the assignment very carefully to ensure that you have followed all instructions and

satisfied all requirements. **You will not get full credit for this program if it is not written as instructed even if it works as expected.**
